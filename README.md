</h1>

## Project Summary

This project visualizes TSA traveler throughput data to analyze trends in airline travel. The Python script fetches and processes TSA checkpoint data, creating interactive visualizations using Plotly to help answer the question: "Is airline travel bouncing back?"

### Hosting History

This project has evolved through several hosting platforms:
- **Datapane** - Initial deployment
- **Chart Studio** - Second iteration
- **Plotly Cloud** - Current hosting solution

## Usage

- **Run the Dash app**: Execute `python "TSA_Traveler_Throughput.py"` to launch the interactive Dash application
- **View visualizations**: Run the `Show_Graph.bat` batch file to generate and display the visualizations
