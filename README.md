In order to generate one of the graphs locally, run one of the the following two commands in the directory where "Graph_Traveler_Throughput.py" lives:

- ``` python "Graph_Traveler_Throughput.py" Show_Graph ```
- ``` python "Graph_Traveler_Throughput.py" Show_Graph_With_SMA ```

Run one of the the following two commands to publish the visualization to [Datapane](https://datapane.com/):

- ``` python "Graph_Traveler_Throughput.py" Publish_Graph ```
- ``` python "Graph_Traveler_Throughput.py" Publish_Graph_With_SMA_Online ```

But of course, the chart studio API key for your account needs to be generated and stored in the correct location...
