# Graphing TSA Traveler Throughput

In order to generate a graph locally, run the one of the following two commands in the directory where "Graph Traveler Throughput.py" lives:

- ``` python "Graph Traveler Throughput.py" Show_Graph ```
- ``` python "Graph Traveler Throughput.py" Show_Graph_With_SMA ```

Run the one of the following two commands to post the visualization online through [plotly chart studio](https://plotly.com/chart-studio/):

- ``` python "Graph Traveler Throughput.py" Publish_Graph ```
- ``` python "Graph Traveler Throughput.py" Publish_Graph_With_SMA_Online ```

But of course, the chart studio API key for your account needs to be generated and stored in the correct location...
